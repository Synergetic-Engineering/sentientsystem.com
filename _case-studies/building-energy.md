## Building Energy

Buildings represent a huge proportion of energy consumption and green house gas emissions in Australia and around the globe. As the maturity of data availability and resolution improves on buildings with smart metering and building management systems, we have been excited to be able to translate our power generation expertise into a new market. By adapting [SentientSystem][home] models and analysis algorithms, we’ve been helping customers that own or manage building assets with number of the different challenges they face.

We have used our capabilities to perform strategic decision support to hospitals, fault detection of HVAC equipment at office and laboratory facilities, monitoring of solar installations on industrial factories, and fleet-wide benchmarking for identifying the highest value opportunities to reduce energy costs.

As well as these jobs, we are also working with a PhD student at QUT who is designing new chilling systems for HVAC that has huge potential to make significant reductions to energy consumption.

We are excited about the potential to make real improvements to building energy efficiency so we are looking for ways to further test and refine our product for the issue. If you would like to be part of our early work in this area, please don’t hesitate to contact us below.
