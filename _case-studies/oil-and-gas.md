## Oil and Gas

For the past 5 years, we have been successfully providing monitoring and early-warning systems in the oil and gas industry, primarily for compressor stations and gas-fired power stations. By operationalising the work of engineers in real-time, we are able to identify opportunities and issues quickly and at a very low cost.

On top of our on-going offering to clients in the area, we’ve recently been configuring [SentientSystem][home] to provide real-time monitoring and optimisation for wells and pumps, specifically within the coal seam gas industry. Drawing upon our existing work in the area, we’ve been working on some experiments with real data from the field with some promising results. It is always nice to know that our offering translates to other parts of the oil and gas value stream, and our team is loving learning the intricacies of new processes, systems and problems.
