## Power Generation

Synengco was founded out of a combined experience of over 25 years working in the industry. Power generation has been our bread and butter ever since. It is an evolving industry, requiring more and more real-time advanced analytics and decision support, to ensure electricity is provided in a cost effective and sustainable manner, regardless of the source. The high criticality, dynamics and complexity mean we are constantly faced with difficult and unique problems to solve, meaning our development can stay cutting-edge.

You can see an work-in-progress sample of power generation components in our SentientSystem modelling library [here](/sentientsystem-library/).

#### Soot Blowing

Many of our power generation clients have benefited from applying [SentientSystem][home] for real-time optimisation to their soot blowing schedule. In all cases, the payback period has been under 12 months, most of which were less than 6 months.

#### Early Warning

Configuring [SentientSystem][home] for early warning and detection of faults on our clientâ€™s plant is another popular offering of ours. By using the hybrid fundamental engineering model in conjunction with empirical data models, the real-time predictive capability that clients gain allows them to be notified of subtle issues well before they turn into big problems.
