In 2011, SentientSystem was utilised as the core technology in an engineering thesis on Performance Engineering. The research involved relating key power plant process metrics to greenhouse gas emissions .

As a project linking university research with industry, SentientSystem provided the integration of power plant sub-sytems, as well as the calculation engine for carbon emissions.

On the user interface side, SentientSystem also provides a significant library of web tools that was used to create dashboards and visualisations related to greenhouse gas emissions.

The ability to have verified measures of carbon emissions in both a monitored and virtualised system gives plant operators the insight and confidence to improve their financial and environmental bottom line in accordance with government regulations.
