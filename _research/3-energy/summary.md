Energy efficiency is a problem that has not been tackled in mining, despite other industries doing so. Mathematical and integration complexity has put a high gap between current understanding and realisable optimisation of mines.

Employee Sam Patterson is a PhD candidate looking to address this, with SentientSystem acting as core technology by providing a modelling framework and calculation engine. Further, SentientSystem is extensible and flexible; capable of working with the real-world simplifications necessary to create a holistic operations model.

Our future doctor is extending this by comprehensively applying the technology to mining subsystems, and using novel computational techniques to make the optimisation solutions possible in real-time.
