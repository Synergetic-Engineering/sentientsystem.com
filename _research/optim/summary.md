SentientSystem was used in an optimisation project with the Electricity Power Research Institute (EPRI) in USA. The goal was to achieve cost savings related to soot blowing practices in a power plant.

EPRI wanted to see how an intelligent system could reduce costs by utilising existing data to provide insight and mathematically optimise the process.

The scope of the project involved research and implementation for applying Sentient System to incorporate multiple processes within a system and achieve optimisation â€“ with no added instrumentation.

Our existing technology made it highly cost-effective to model the process, implement optimisation calculations, and automatically control the complex interactions. A web tool allowed operators to check on the performance improvements being achieved.

The project achieved payback of 12 months, through measured increase in unit efficiency. A 40% increase in mean time between failure for high-wear assets in the system was also achieved, significantly increasing the reliability of the plant and further increasing the value from the system.
